# My Favorite Colors - colors.danielchapman.dev
This site uses the Twitter API to get a list of colors I've liked from the [@everycolorbot](https://twitter.com/everycolorbot) and then passes them to a Svelte site that uses them to generate this page at build time.

I wrote about building this site in [this article](https://www.dschapman.com/articles/how-i-used-twitter-as-a-cms)
